# EAS Update Tool
A barebones utility cli tool to help me versioning and deploy of the multiple expo projects I'm currently managing while being simple and intuitive enough for co-workers to do the same.
As it stands right now the project has zero options for configuration. It assumes the use of an `app.config.js` file with the env values EXPO_PUBLIC_VERISON and EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT.

### ROADMAP
- [ ] Add a deploy step.
- [ ] Add an autogenerated config file where variable names and steps can be changed to different workflows.
- [ ] Create a fancier README.md
- [ ] A GitHub Actions integrations
